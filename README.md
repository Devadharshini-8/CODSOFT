## 🗂️ TASK LIST

### 🔹 Task 1 – Tic Tac Toe Game with AI

> 🎮 A classic 2-player game where the computer plays intelligently using the **Minimax Algorithm**.

- Built using Python
- Terminal-based interface
- AI opponent that always makes optimal moves

📁 Folder: `Task 1 - Tic Tac Toe with AI`  
📄 Main File: `tictactoe.py`

### 🔹 Task 2 – Movie Recommendation System

> 🎬 A simple content-based movie recommender using **Cosine Similarity**.

- Built using Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Recommends movies based on description similarity
- Helps understand basic recommendation engines

📁 Folder: `Task 2 - Movie Recommendation System`  
📄 Main File: `recommendation.py`

---

### 🔹 Task 3 – Face Detection and Recognition

> 🧠 A deep learning-based system that recognizes faces from both **live webcam** and **uploaded videos**.

- Built using `face_recognition`, OpenCV, NumPy
- Uses known face images to identify people
- Works on real-time webcam feed or pre-recorded videos

📁 Folder: `Task 3 - Face Detection and Recognition`  
📄 Main File: `face_recog_from_uploaded_video.py`  
📂 Folders:
- `known_faces/` – for storing reference images *(currently empty for privacy)*
- `unknown_faces/` – for uploading videos for testing *(currently empty for privacy)*

## 🚀 HOW TO RUN

### 1. Install Required Libraries:

```bash
pip install opencv-python face_recognition numpy

For Task 1:

python tictactoe.py

For Task 2:

python movie_recommender.py

For Task 3 (video face recognition): Place a video inside unknown_faces/, a known face image in known_faces/, then run:

python face_recog_from_uploaded_video.py
